PART 1: 7-DAY JAVA INTERVIEW PREPARATION PLAN (7+ YEARS) ⏱️ Daily effort: 3–4 hours

🔥 DAY 1 – Core Java Foundations (HIGH IMPACT)
Topics
HashMap internals (hashing, collision, rehashing)
equals() & hashCode() contract
Immutability
String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
Comparable vs Comparator
Must Practice
What happens if hashCode returns same value?
Override equals but not hashCode – what breaks?
Interview Focus: “Explain with internal working + real bug you faced”

🔥 DAY 2 – Java 8 / Streams (VERY IMPORTANT)
Topics
Stream pipeline internals
map vs flatMap
reduce vs collect
Functional interfaces
Optional – correct & wrong usage
Parallel streams pitfalls
Must Practice
Stateful vs stateless operations
Why reduce() should not mutate objects
Why streams are lazy

🔥 DAY 3 – Multithreading & Concurrency (CRITICAL)
Topics
Thread lifecycle (inside JVM)
synchronized vs ReentrantLock
volatile & happens-before
ExecutorService
ThreadLocal
Deadlock & prevention
ConcurrentHashMap internals
Must Practice
Race condition examples
Why volatile is not atomic
When NOT to use synchronization

🔥 DAY 4 – JVM & Performance (SENIOR FAVORITE)
Topics

JVM memory model
Stack vs Heap
Metaspace
Garbage Collectors (G1, CMS, Parallel)
OOM causes
Memory leaks
Must Practice: GC tuning scenarios
Heap dump analysis (theoretical)

🔥 DAY 5 – Spring & Spring Boot (MANDATORY)
Topics
Bean lifecycle
@Component vs @Service vs @Repository
@Bean vs @Component
@Autowired internals
@Transactional (rollback rules)
Propagation & Isolation
Exception handling
Must Practice: Why @Transactional fails sometimes
Self-invocation problem

🔥 DAY 6 – Database, JPA & Microservices
Topics
Lazy vs Eager loading
N+1 problem
save vs persist vs merge
Dirty checking
Pagination
REST API design
Rate limiting
Circuit breaker
Idempotency
Must Practice: Designing scalable APIs
Handling distributed transactions

🔥 DAY 7 – Mock Interviews & Behavioral Questions
Topics
Design decisions & trade-offs
Production issues
Performance improvements
Mentoring juniors
Code review handling
Practice
Explain one real system end-to-end
Whiteboard a simple system

✅ PART 2: REAL INTERVIEWER FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

These are what interviewers ask AFTER your first answer 👇
Core Java Follow-ups
“What happens if two keys have same hash but equals returns false?”
“Why HashMap is not thread-safe?”
“How does TreeMap maintain order internally?”

Java 8 Follow-ups
“Why reduce is dangerous with mutable objects?”
“When will parallelStream give wrong results?”
“Explain internal working of stream pipeline”

Concurrency Follow-ups
“Explain happens-before with example”
“Can volatile replace synchronized?”
“How does ConcurrentHashMap avoid locking?”

JVM Follow-ups
“What happens when Eden is full?”
“Difference between minor and major GC?”
“How do you debug memory leak in production?”

Spring Follow-ups
“Why @Transactional doesn’t work on private methods?”
“What happens if an exception is caught inside @Transactional?”
“How does Spring create proxies?”

System Design Follow-ups
“How will you design rate limiting?”
“How do you handle API retries?”
“What if one microservice goes down?”

Behavioral Follow-ups
“What trade-off would you change now?”
“What did you learn from that failure?”
“How did you convince stakeholders?”
