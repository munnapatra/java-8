Difference between HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, SynchronizedMap and real-time scenarios where you used them.
| Feature     | HashMap   | SynchronizedMap    | ConcurrentHashMap |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Thread-safe | ❌       | ✅                  | ✅               |
| Locking     | None      | Entire map         | Bucket-level      |
| Performance | High      | Low                | High              |
| Null key    | ✅        | ✅                | ❌                 |
| Null value  | ✅        | ✅                | ❌                 |
| Iteration   | Fail-fast | Must sync manually | Weakly consistent |

Q1. What are the main features introduced in Java 8 ?
Ans:
1.Lambda Expressions
2. Functional Interfaces
3. Stream API
4. Default and Static methods in Interfaces
5. java.time API (Date and Time)
6. Optional class
7. CompletableFuture and Parallel Streams
8. Method references

Q2. What is a Lambda Expression?
Ans:
lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are used primarily to define the implementation of a functional interface (an interface with only one abstract method).Syntax of Lambda Expression:(parameters) -expressionor(parameters) - {
    // statements
    return value;
}

Q3. Why Lambda Expressions Were Introduced?
Ans:
Lambda expressions were introduced to:
 Simplify code by enabling functional programming features
 Removing boilerplate
 Improving readability
Providing a better way to work with functional interfaces and collections.

Q4. What is a Functional Interface?
Ans:
An interface with exactly one abstract method.Examples: Runnable, Callable, Comparator, Function, Predicate, etc.
You can use @FunctionalInterface annotation for clarity.

Benefit
Explanation
Enables lambda expressions
Foundation for functional programming in Java
Simplifies code
Less boilerplate (no anonymous inner classes)
Stream API integration
Used with map, filter, forEach, etc.
Enables behavior as data
You can pass behavior (methods) as parameters
Works with built-in interfaces
Like Function, Predicate, etc.

Q5. What is difference between map and flatMap?
Ans:
 The map() method in Java Stream API is used to transform each element of a stream into another object, applying a function to each element in the stream.Purpose of map():
Used to transform or convert data.
Does not modify the original stream but creates a new stream.
The flatMap() method is used to transform and flatten complex or nested data structures—especially when each element of a stream contains a collection (e.g., List, Set, Stream).Purpose of flatMap:
Use flatMap() when each element in the original stream needs to be converted to a stream, and then flattened into a single stream.


-------------------------------------------------------------
What happens inside JVM when a thread is created?
-------------------------------------------------------------
When a thread is created, 
JVM creates a Java Thread object, 
start() -> requests the OS to create a native thread,
allocates a thread stack and PC register(RUNNABLE), and hands execution to the OS scheduler, which eventually executes the run() method.
